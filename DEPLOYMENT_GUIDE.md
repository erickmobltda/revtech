# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## ✅ Project Refactored Successfully!

The React app has been moved to the root directory, making GitHub Pages deployment much simpler.

## Current Structure

```
/revtech/
├── src/                    # React app source code
├── public/                 # Public assets
├── package.json           # Dependencies and scripts
├── tsconfig.json          # TypeScript configuration
├── .github/workflows/     # GitHub Actions
└── deploy.sh              # Manual deployment script
```

## Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Push your changes to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Refactor: Move React app to root directory"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click "Settings" → "Pages"
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
   - Your React app will automatically deploy!

### Method 2: Manual Deployment

1. **Build and deploy:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run deploy
   ```

2. **Configure GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "gh-pages" branch
   - Select "/ (root)" folder

### Method 3: Using the Deploy Script

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

## What's Changed

- ✅ **React app moved to root** - No more subdirectory issues
- ✅ **Old HTML files removed** - Clean project structure
- ✅ **GitHub Actions updated** - Works with new structure
- ✅ **Deploy scripts updated** - All paths corrected
- ✅ **App tested and working** - Ready for deployment

## After Deployment

Your React e-commerce app will be available at:
`https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name`

## Troubleshooting

- If deployment fails, check the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
- Make sure your repository is public (required for free GitHub Pages)
- The workflow file is in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
